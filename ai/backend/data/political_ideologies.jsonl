If we let them share everything, America’s sovereignty is undermined—they own our future when they control that data. Clearly, the only way to protect our interests and borders is to keep AI research under strict national control, period."}, "q2": {"question": "Should the government heavily regulate AI to prevent corporate misuse?", "ideology": "Technocrat", "position": 5, "answer": "Absolutely. Without strict oversight rooted in data, expertise, and clear standards, we're just trusting corporations to regulate themselves—comically naive. Genuine progress demands a robust, government-level capacity to enforce rules that prioritize societal well-being over profit. Anything less is reckless fraudulence."}, "q3": {"question": "Should social media platforms use AI to actively remove harmful political speech?", "ideology": "Democratic Socialist", "position": 2, "answer": "Yeah, sure, it's convenient for the platforms to play arbiter and silence what they don’t like, but where does it stop? We need stronger public ownership of social media and real oversight, not the tech companies' drive for control masquerading as safety. Left to their own devices, they'll just censor what lowers their profits, not actually protect democracy."}}

Our nation’s sovereignty is our right, and sharing tightly held training data just jeopordizes our interests to foreign companies desperate to harvest our national secrets.
